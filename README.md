# Advanced-Image-Compression-and-Restoration-Techniques

This repository contains the project files and codebase for the exploration of Advanced Image Compression and Restoration Techniques. The project focuses on enhancing compression efficiency and restoring high-quality images using both traditional methods and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

### Overview
#### Objectives
- To study and compare traditional, modern, and deep learning-based image compression methods.
- To implement restoration methods using GANs and Autoencoders.
- To evaluate performance on the DIV2K dataset with metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

#### Challenges
- Balancing compression efficiency, image quality, and computational complexity.
- Handling hardware and dataset limitations.

#### Proposed Solution
A model combining state-of-the-art compression formats (e.g., AVIF, WebP) with deep learning-based restoration techniques to improve image quality.

### Repository Structure
üìÅ Data Preperation
- Data_Preparation.ipynb
- Jupyter notebook to download and prepare the DIV2K dataset from Kaggle.
    - Output: Training, validation, and test datasets with both high-resolution and degraded low-resolution images.

üìÅ Image Compression
- Image_Compression_Final.ipynb
- Implements and compares 5 image compression algorithms (3 traditional: JPEG, PNG, JPEG2000; and 2 modern: AVIF, WebP). Evaluates results using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, compression ratio, and decoding time.

üìÅ Image Restoration
- DnCNN/
    - DnCNN.ipynb
    - Implements a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for image denoising and evaluates using PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.

### Key Features
#### Compression Methods:

- Traditional: JPEG, PNG, JPEG2000.
- Modern: AVIF, WebP.

#### Restoration Models:

- GANs for super-resolution and restoration.
- Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

#### Evaluation Metrics:

- Compression Ratio
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
- LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)

#### Dataset:
- DIV2K: High-resolution dataset with diverse scenes and textures.


### Limitations
- Computational complexity of deep learning models.
- Dependence on high-quality datasets.
- Generalization challenges in real-world scenarios.
